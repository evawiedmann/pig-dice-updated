# Pig Dice Testing

## Created by Eva Wiedmann and Lara Bjork on November 13, 2019

### Project Description
This project was completed as part of the Epicodus in-class curriculum. The task description was as follows:

As stated in the prompt from Epicodus, the project objectives are to:

Choose an application you built in Intro (such as Roman Numeral, Pig Dice, or Triangle Tracker). Refactor the application to include the following:

* Complete unit tests with Jest. Aim for 100% test coverage.
* Complete separation of logic (UI logic in one file, business logic in another). You may even need to refactor some of your logic to make it more testable! If you arenâ€™t able to test UI logic, consider ways that logic could be refactored and moved into your business logic file.

Practice with Jest and testing is your top priority!

Input: user enter their name.

Output: newGame objects created; objects are pushed to array.

Behavior: should correctly roll a number 1-6.
Input: user clicks on roll button.

Behavior: should add tempTotal to permTotal.
Input: player clicks on roll, then hold
Output: random number generated, points added to tempTotal; then, after hold clicked, points added to permTotal.
